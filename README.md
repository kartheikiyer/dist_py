Statistical Tests Comparing Nonparametric Distributions in > 1 Dimensions

Heavily adapted from multdist for MATLAB by Brian Lau. (https://github.com/brian-lau/multdist)

Currently includes 

- the 2d KS test from Fasano & Franceschini (1987) 
- the energy distance measure based on Aslan & Zech (2005) and Szekely & Rizzo (2014)
- the Hotelling T^2 test for normality from Mardia, Kent and Bibby (1979)
- an adaptation of the KL divergence for comparing distributions. To be expanded into the mutual information as a symmetrized comparison between two distributions.
